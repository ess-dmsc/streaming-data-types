# Streaming Data Types

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/81330954.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/81330954)

FlatBuffers is the format chosen for the ESS messaging system.

We would like to be able to read any message in the system at any time,
therefore:

All schemas that we use for the transmission of data are collected in this
repository.

The names of the schema files in this repository are prefixed by their unique
4-character `file_identifier`.  This `file_identifier` must be set in the
schema definition file as:
```
file_identifier = "abcd";
```

The file identifiers (also called "schema id") must be unique on the network.
The `root_type` should include the schema version number. For example, the f144 schema has
the `root_type`:
```
root_type f144_LogData;
```

The naming convention for new identifiers and a table of existing identifiers follows later in this README.
Please add your own (new schema) with file identifier to that table.


## Backwards compatibility

Please, avoid changes which break binary compatibility. FlatBuffers documentation contains good information about how to maintain binary compatibility. If you need to make breaking changes to schemas that are not under development, acquire a new schema id.

Schemas that are under development should be clearly marked as such in the schema file and in the **Schema ids** below to warn users of possible loss of backwards compatibility.

## Not enough file identifiers available?

If you feel that you may need a lot of schema ids, you can use a single schema
and work with the flat buffers union data type in your root element.


## Schema coding standard

* Completely new schemas should have an ID comprising of two characters plus 00, e.g. hs00
* When updating an existing schema with a breaking change then the new schema should have the same ID but with the number incremented, e.g. hs00 -> hs01
  * For older schema which don't end with two numbers, propose a new name which matches the convention.
* Prefix your schema files in this repository with the chosen schema id to more easily prevent id collision.
* Tables should use *UpperCamelCase*.
* Fields should use *snake_case*.
* Try to keep names consistent with equivalent fields in existing schema, e.g.:
  * `timestamp` for timestamp
  * `source_name` for a string indicating origin/source of data in flatbuffer
  * `service_id` for a string indicating the name of the service that created the flatbuffer
* Do not use unsigned integers unless required for your application.
